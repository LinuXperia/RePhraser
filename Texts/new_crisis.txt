but to go from the extremes of danger to safety- from the tumult
of war to the tranquillity of peace , though sweet in contemplation ,
requires a gradual composure of the senses to get it . even
calmness has the power of stunning , when it opens to_a_fault straightaway upon
us . The long and raging hurricane that should stop in a moment , would
leave_behind us in a state preferably of wonder than enjoyment ; and some
moments of recollection must go , before we could Be capable of
tasting the felicity of repose . There be merely few instances , in
which the mind is fitted for sudden transitions : it takes in its
pleasures by reflection and comparison and those must get time to
play , before the relish for new scenes is complete .

uncertainties of fate it has undergone- the numerous and complicated
dangers we get suffered OR escaped- the eminence we straightaway stand_up on , and
the vast prospect before us , must all complot to shanghai us with
contemplation .
