My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.
I challenge a new generation of YOUNG Americans to a season of service, 
to act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company 
with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.  There is so much 
to be done.  Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young 
in spirit, to give of themselves in service, too.  In serving we recognize 
a simple, but powerful, truth:  we need each other, and we must care for 
one another.  Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate 
ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution, 
and renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea tempered by 
the knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, 
might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation 
can summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity; 
an idea infused with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic 
journey must go forever upward.
